One of my favorite artists, <a href="" target="_blank">flatsound<a>, has a song called "it's sunday, april 19th and i miss you".

So I made a simple little site to calculate when the next occurrence of that date is. That way I don't miss it.

Check it out <a href="https://sunday-april-19th.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
