gaydients is a collection of lgbtqiap+ gradients made with css. they help make the web gay.

I made this because I tend to use rainbow / trans flag gradients a lot when prototyping, particularly in hackathons.

The sass that generates the flags is super neat and extensible. I geek out about things like that.
