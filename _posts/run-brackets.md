Run Brackets was a bracket manager built on top of the Challonge API. It was (probably) the first web application of its kind, modeled after <a href="https://smashboards.com/threads/challonge-match-display-application-helping-tournaments-run-faster.358186/" target="_blank">Challonge Match Display</a>.

It's currently no longer live, as API changes made the station manager (completely new functionality I built on top of the API) break, with no apparent work-around.

I have plans on reviving it, as multiple tournament organizers (TOs) for different Smash Bros games have personally reached out to me. Complete rewrites take time.

This project is super close to my heart, as a competitive Melee player and former TO.
